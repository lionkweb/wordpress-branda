## Why Branda?

Have you ever wished that WordPress looked a little less like… well… WordPress? Branda’s got you covered. It’s your backstage pass to full control, so you can totally transform your builds, hide back-end elements and make WordPress feel like your platform.

  

Whether you’re a freelancer, agency or solo site owner, Branda makes it easy to look like an absolute pro and give your clients a smooth, consistent experience.

### Branded Login Screens

Turn your login page into a brand statement.

  

Make the front door of your website unmistakably yours, with the ability to design sleek login pages featuring custom logos, colors and messaging. No CSS needed.

### Multisite Branding Made Easy

Total brand control across your network.

  

Running a multisite setup? Apply custom branding across your whole network with one click. Branda lets you adjust global settings from one central hub, so you’ll never need to rebrand every subsite manually.

### Admin Area Customization

Give your dashboard a designer makeover.

  

With Branda, the backend of your site will be just as polished as the front. Swap out WP logos, customize menus, update the footer and streamline admin UI elements, so it feels like a custom-built experience from start to finish.

### White Label System Emails

Professional emails that always look on-brand.

  

Who wants boring WordPress system emails? You can add your own HTML templates to your system emails, so clients get password resets and notifications in your style, colors and brand voice. You can also set the “from” email address and switch to SMTP if your emails are ending up in the trash.

### Cookies Never Looked So Good

Stay compliant, without compromising your aesthetic.

  

Activate Branda’s Cookie notice tool and create opt-ins that align with your style, colors and brand voice. Comply with GDPR while making your sites look 100% professional.

### Maintenance Mode & Coming Soon Pages

Keep your brand visible, even while your site’s under construction.

  

Create beautiful, branded maintenance pages with countdowns, opt-ins, and messaging. Keep your site visitors informed and engaged while you work behind the scenes.

### Custom Dashboard Widgets

Give clients what they need, not what they don’t.

  

Add helpful instructions, links, and updates right inside the dashboard, or clean it up and simplify it completely. Control what your users see based on their role.

### Toolbar, Menus, & Access Control

Fine-tune the backend experience for every user.

  

Hide admin bars, control menu visibility, and redirect users after login. Perfect for client sites, membership platforms, or any project with multiple user types.

### White Label Mode

Your brand, Your rules. No WordPress in sight.

  

Hide all traces of WordPress, WPMU DEV, and third-party plugins. Clients will only see your brand - creating a polished, professional experience that builds trust.
